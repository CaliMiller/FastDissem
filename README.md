A very alpha Python script to cross-post among user-definable social media sites and automatically post weather alerts from the NWS for a user-defined location.

## The long description
I'm a coding novice, and just entering the world of running a home lab. One of my projects is running a website with a local news aggregator - https://shelbylight.house, and I want a suite that can automatically post to the various associated social media accounts. There's plenty of paid options that do just this, but I have a home lab for a reason, and would rather run it locally for free, than pay a monthly subscription.

I recently used ChatGPT to code some weather pages for digital signage - https://shelbylight.house/weather/, and was amazed at how well it worked. I even used ChatGPT to write a Python script to monitor my Youtube account and share any new video to my Bluesky account. So I figured, maybe ChatGPT can code a whole Python-based suite to post weather alerts to various socials. I then decided to expand on this idea by adding functionality to manually write posts, and for the script to monitor all of the social media accounts, and cross post anything that's posted to one, to all the others. Yeah, I know that's a lot of functionality for a beginner's script.

Well, that idea seemed to overload ChatGPT. After some prodding, it spit out various pieces of code, but didn't do much to organize them into a file structure. With all the prodding, I frequently hit my chat limit, and have to wait til it resets. A lot of what ChatGPT has spit out needs tweaking and organization, so I figured maybe others would find this project useful, and I could crowdsource some coding. So I'm uploading it to GitHub.

I'm retired, and all of this is a hobby for me. My use case isn't for anything mission-critical. This code comes with no warranty. Use at your own risk. Feel free to contribute. I'm really new to GitHub, so bare with me.

Spread love and peace throughout the world.
